# pinn_spring-mass-damper_system
The environment.yml provides the conda environment used to run the single_mass/two_mass and 03_wave equation folders. SA-PINN has its own environment.yml file.

The code in the following folders was only adapted by me and not originally written.

Code in folder SA_PINNs is taken and adapted from:
https://github.com/levimcclenny/SA-PINN

Code in 03_wave folder originally from:
https://github.com/ShotaDeguchi/PINN_TF2

The implementations of the PINNs in the one and two mass cases are based on
https://github.com/frohrhofer/PINN_TF2
